# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds the missing commit functionality to the existing Git web interface application. The application currently supports checking git status, adding files to staging, viewing commit history, and initializing repositories, but lacks the ability to create commits with custom messages. This endpoint will complete the core Git workflow by allowing users to commit staged changes through the web interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Git web interface, I want to create commits with custom messages, so that I can save my staged changes to the repository with meaningful descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a POST request to `/api/commit` with a commit message THEN the system SHALL create a new Git commit with the provided message
2. WHEN a user provides a commit message in the request body THEN the system SHALL use that message for the commit
3. WHEN the commit is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success response with commit details
4. WHEN there are no staged changes to commit THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
5. WHEN the commit message is empty or missing THEN the system SHALL return a validation error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for commit operations, so that I can understand what went wrong when commits fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Git commit command fails THEN the system SHALL return a 500 status code with error details
2. WHEN there are no changes to commit THEN the system SHALL return a meaningful error message
3. WHEN the working directory is not a Git repository THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error
4. WHEN the commit message validation fails THEN the system SHALL return a 400 status code with validation details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the commit endpoint to follow the same patterns as other endpoints, so that the API is consistent and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the commit endpoint is called THEN it SHALL follow the same response format as other endpoints (success, error, details)
2. WHEN the commit is successful THEN the response SHALL include the commit hash and message
3. WHEN using the commit endpoint THEN it SHALL use the same error handling middleware as other endpoints
4. WHEN the commit endpoint processes requests THEN it SHALL use async/await patterns consistent with the codebase
